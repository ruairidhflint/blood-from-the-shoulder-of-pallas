      <h1>BLOOD FROM THE SHOULDER OF PALLAS</h1>
      <h2>Watchmen, Chapter 7</h2>
      <p>
        Is it possible, I wonder, to study a bird so closely, to observe and
        catalogue its peculiarities in such minute detail, that it becomes
        invisible? Is it possible that while fastidiously calibrating the span
        of its wings or the length of its tarsus, we somehow lose sight of its
        poetry? That in our pedestrian descriptions of a marbled or vermiculated
        plumage we forfeit a glimpse of living canvases, cascades of carefully
        toned browns and golds that would shame Kandinsky, misty explosions of
        color to rival Monet? I believe that we do. I believe that in
        approaching our subject with the sensibilities of statisticians and
        dissectionists, we distance ourselves increasingly from the marvelous
        and spell binding planet of imagination whose gravity drew us to our
        studies in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not to say that we should cease to establish facts and to verify
        our information, but merely to suggest that unless those facts can be
        imbued with the flash of poetic insight then they remain dull gems;
        semi-precious stones scarcely worth the collecting. When we stare into
        the catatonic black bead of a Parakeet's eye we must teach ourselves to
        glimpse the cold, alien madness that Max Ernst perceived when he chose
        to robe his naked brides in confections of scarlet feather and the
        transplanted monstrous heads of exotic birds.

        When some ocean-going Kite or Tern is captured in the sharp blue gaze of
        our Zeiss lenses, we must be able to see the stop motion flight of sepia
        gulls through the early kinetic photographs of Muybridge, beating white
        wings tracing a slow oscilloscope line through space and time. Looking
        at a hawk, we see the minute differences in width of the shaft lines on
        the underfeathers where the Egyptians once saw Horus and the burning eye
        of holy vengeance incarnate. Until we transform our mere sightings into
        genuine visions; until our ear is mature enough to order a symphony from
        the shrill pandemonium of the aviary; until then we may have a hobby,
        but we shall not have a passion.

        When I was a boy, my passion was for owls. During the long summers of
        the early fifties, while the rest of the country was apparently watching
        the skies for incoming flying saucers or Soviet missiles, I would hare
        across the New England fields in the heart of the night, sneakers
        munching through the dried grass and bracken towards my watch, where I
        would sit peering upwards in hope of a different sort of spectacle, ears
        straining for the weird scream that meant an old bird was out combing
        the dark for sustenance, a mad hermit screech, glaringly distinct from
        the snoring hiss of a younger owl.
      </p>
      <p>
        Somewhere over the years; sometime during the yawning expanse between
        those snug years in the afterglow of a war well won and these current
        times, huddled in the looming shadow of a war un-winnable; some-place
        along the line my passion got lost, unwittingly refined from the
        original gleaming ore down to a banal and lustreless filing system. This
        gradual tarnishing had gone unnoticed, unchecked, finally calcifying
        into unthinking habit. It was not until comparatively recently that I
        managed to catch a dazzling glimpse of the mother-lode through the
        accumulated dust of methodical study and academia: visiting a sick
        acquaintance at a hospital in Maine on behalf of a mutual friend,
        walking back across the shadowy parking lot with my mind reduced to
        blankness by the various concerns of the day, I suddenly and
        unexpectedly heard the cry of a hunting owl.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a bird advanced in years, its shriek that of a deranged old man,
        wheeling madly through the dark and freezing sky against the ragged
        night clouds, and the sound halted me in my footsteps. It is a fallacy
        to suppose that owls screech to startle their prey from hiding, as some
        have suggested; the cry of the hunting owl is a voice from Hell, and it
        turns the scrabbling voles to statues, roots the weasel to the soil. In
        my instant of paralysis there on the glistening macadam, between the
        sleeping auto-mobiles, I understood the purpose behind the cry with a
        biting clarity, the way I'd understood it as a boy, belly flat against
        the warm summer earth. In that extended and timeless moment, I felt the
        kinship of simple animal fear along with all those other creatures much
        smaller and more vulnerable than I who had heard the scream as I had
        heard it, were struck motionless as I was. The owl was not attempting to
        frighten his food into revealing itself. Perched with disconcerting
        stillness upon its branch for hours, drinking in the darkness through
        dilated and thirsty pupils, the owl had already spotted its dinner. The
        screech served merely to transfix the chosen morsel, pinning it to the
        ground with a shrill nail of blind, helpless terror. Not knowing which
        of us had been selected, I stood frozen along with the rodents of the
        field, my heart hammering as it waited for the sudden clutch of
        sharpened steel fingers that would provide my first and only indication
        that I was the predetermined victim.
      </p>
      <p>
        The feathers of owls are soft and downy; they make no sound at all as
        they drop through the dark stratas of the sky. The silence before an owl
        swoops is a V-Bomb silence, and you never hear the one that hits you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Somewhere away in the crepuscular gloom beyond the yellow-lit hospital
        grounds I thought I heard something small emit its ultimate squeal. The
        moment had passed. I could move again, along with all the relieved,
        invisible denizens of the tall gass. We were safe. It wasn't screaming
        for us, not this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We could continue with our nocturnal business, with our lives, searching
        for a meal or a mate. We were not twitching nervelessly in stifling,
        stinking darkness, head first down the gullet of the swooping horror,
        our tails dangling pathetically from that vicious scimitar beak for
        hours before finally our hind legs and pelvic girdle are disgorged, our
        empty, matted skin curiously inverted by the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I had recovered my motor abilities in the aftermath of the
        owl's shriek, I found that my equilibrium was not so easily regained.
        Some facet of the experience had struck a chord in me, forged a
        connection between my dulled and jaded adult self and the child who
        sprawled in faint starlight while the great night hunters staged dramas
        full of hunger and death in the opaque jet air above me. An urge to
        experience rather than merely record had been rekindled within me,
        prompting the thought processes, the self-evaluation that has led to
        this current article.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I remarked earlier, this is not to suggest that I immediately
        foreswore all academic endeavor and research pertaining to the field in
        order to run away and eke out some naked and primordial existence in the
        woods. Quite the contrary: I hurled myself into the study of my subject
        with renewed fervor, able to see the dry facts and arid descriptions in
        the same transforming magical light that had favoured them when I was
        younger. A scientific understanding of the beautifully synchronized and
        articulated motion of an owl's individual feathers during flight does
        not impede a poetic appreciation of the same phenomenon. Rather, the two
        enhance each other, a more lyrical eye lending the cold data a romance
        from which it has long been divorced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immersing myself avidly in dusty and long untouched reference books I
        came across forgotten passages that would make mc almost breathless,
        dreary-looking tomes that would reveal themselves to be treasure houses
        of iridescent wonder, I rediscovered many long-lost gems amongst the
        cobwebs, antique and functional stretches of descriptive prose which
        nonetheless conveyed the violent and terrible essence of their subject
        matter effortlessly.
      </p>
      <p>
        I stumbled once more across T.A. Coward's engrossing account on an
        encounter with an Eagle Owl: "In Norway I saw a bird that had been taken
        when in down from the nest, but it not only assumed the typical
        terrifying attitude, but made frequent dashes at the wire, striking with
        its feet. It puffed its feathers out, framed its head in its wings, and
        fired off a volley of loud cracks from its snapping beak, but what
        struck me most was the scintillating flash of its great orange eyes."
        Then of course there is Hudson's account of the Magellanic Eagle-Owl
        which he wounded in Patagonia: "The irides were of a bright orange
        color, but every time I attempted to approach the bird they kindled into
        great globes of quivering yellow flame, the black pupils being
        surrounded by a scintillating crimson light which threw out minute
        yellow sparks into the air." In long-buried words such as the foregoing
        I caught some of the searing, apocalyptic intensity that I had felt in
        that wet hospital parking lot in Maine.
      </p>

        Nowadays, when I observe some specimen of Caine noctua, I try to look
        past the fine grey down on the toes, to see beyond the white spots
        arranged in neat lines, like a firework display across its brow.
        Instead, I try to see the bird whose image the Greeks carved into their
        coins, sitting patiently at the ear of the Goddess Pallas Athene,
        silently sharing her immortal wisdom. Perhaps, instead of measuring the
        feathered tufts surmounting its ears, we should speculate on what those
        ears may have heard. Perhaps when considering the manner in which it
        grips its branch, with two toes in front and the reversible outer toe
        clutching from behind, we should allow ourselves to pause for a moment,
        and acknowledge that these same claws must once have drawn blood from
        the shoulder of Pallas.
